      <p class="w3-large">Problems, problems, problems</p>
      <p>
        Computers are sophisticated, complex machines and are generally very reliable. Operating systems do alot to remove complexity 
        simplifying down to a few choices in mostly logical and intuitive ways, but inevitably things can and will go wrong.
        Some errors can be as simple to fix as restarting the device. However a good many problems come about
        through having made a choice or sequence of choices (changes to a configuration) that may have solved one problem
        but has colateral and quite unintended consequences for something else
        or it could be a permanent or intermitent hardware fault 
        or it could be a multitude of other possibilities too
        We can help here too but we also need your help as well. It's very helpful to know any error messages, a photo of the screen 
        at point of failure/error is incredibly useful as well, and a clear recollection of what was being used/done at the time. Any details
        about what appeared on screen and the sequence of events can prove useful - all can reduce service costs and time
      </p>

      <p class="w3-large">Break-fix, Second life and disposal</p>
      <p >
        Electronic devices and components fail or get broken, are superceeded by new technology, become surplus to requirements
        or unfit for purpose and should be disposed of or replaced. 
        They should not be disposed of in normal rubbish because they contain toxins and they contain many valuable
        materials in small quantities, so they need recycling and not in typical household recycling facilities. 
        Not many facilities exist for the disposal of electronics but sometimes equipment can be re-purposed, 
        gifted and used by less affluent or put to use in less demanding functions. We'll advise on options and help where possible. 
        We offer a limited break-fix service, typically component replacement or upgrades like power supplies, hard drives and memory. 
        We can also recover data in a few circumstances although this can quickly become a highly complex task best dealt with by specialist services.

  <div class="w3-row-padding">
    <h4>Technophiles know quite a lot about tech and it's great to share that joy</h4>
    <div class="w3-col m6">
      <p><strong>Press F1 for Help</strong> wants to help people with impartial advice, knowledge and assistance
        when purchasing or using computers, peripherals and electronics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Computers are hugely capable and sophisticated devices and using one safely and effectively in the current day
        requires a reasonably broad level of knowledge and a good deal of common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are so many devices to choose from, and all are built, produced or optimised for different purposes
        so making informed choices in the marketplace can be daunting. No-one wants to throw money away and everyone wants value for money. 
        In Information Technology you get what you pay for, but it may not always be the best or even a good choice for you
      </p>
      <p>
        When looking to make purchases, <strong>Press F1 for Help</strong> can explain the pros and cons in frank, impartial and plain language, 
        de-mystifying complex topics, guiding you through the process of selection and purchase, eliminating confusion or frustration 
        and putting you back in control of what’s best for you and what you want to do.       
      </p>
      <p>
        And it doesn’t always end at hardware purchases and guarantees.
        There’s email, photos, data transfers, printers, inks, licenses, subscriptions, fibre or internet providers, 
        phone usage, virus, scam avoidance, privacy and protection issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadly, there’s more and more bad actors out there, so staying safe is more and more important 
        and there’s many that just want your money whether it’s good for you or not -
        <strong>Caveat Emptor</strong> has never been more relevant, or in plain language - Let the Buyer beware.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Press F1 for Help</strong> can de-mystify and reduce the complexity to simple straight forward ‘maxims’ and procedures.
        Advice and assistance is just a phone/video/internet call, email or in-person visit away if and when you may need that.

      7. WARRANTY
      <ol>
        <li>We warrant that we will use reasonable skill and care in undertaking the Services.</li>
        <li>No warranty is given for the Products where any failure or defect results from:
          <p>(a) improper storage or handling of the Products by you, your employees, agents or customers;</p>
          <p>(b) use, installation, modification or alteration (including repair) of the Products other than as recommended or authorised in writing

        </li>
        <li>Except as otherwise provided in the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 and the Fair Trading Act and subject to clause 8.1 of these terms and conditions 
          your sole remedy in relation to the breach of any warranty under this agreement or at law, in relation to any:
        <p>(a) Service, will be for us to re-perform such Services to the required standard; or</p>
        <p>(b) Product, will be for us to repair or replace such Product, at our option, provided that if neither option is available to us (as determined solely by us) 
          we may refund the price paid for that Product.</p>
        </li>
        <li>We have no obligation to install, customise or provide any other Service in relation to any Products repaired or replaced due to a breach of any Product warranty.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that if the Services or Products are supplied for business purposes in terms of the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 the guarantees 
          provided under that Act do not apply.</li>
        <li>Other than the warranties set out in these Terms and Conditions, all other express or implied warranties in respect of the Services and Products 
          are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. 
          All statements, technical information and recommendations made by the manufacturer and/or us about the Services or Products are believed to be reliable, 
          but do not constitute a guarantee or warranty express or implied by us to you.</li>
          <li>You warrant that you are authorised to arrange each On-site Visit and, in providing the Services or Products, our access to your premises, use of the equipment,

            Under the CGA:
            
            All Products Must:
            
            – be of acceptable quality (durable, safe, ft for purpose, free from defects, acceptable in look or finish)
            – be fit for any particular purpose you have told the supplier
            – match a description, sample or model shown to you
            – have good legal title, e.g. be able to be sold and not have any security interests registered against them
            – be a reasonable price if no price is set
            – arrive on time (within a reasonable time if not agreed) and in good condition
            – have spare parts and repair facilities available (manufacturer is responsible). This does not apply if you are told about limited availability before you buy.
            
            If these guarantees are not met, the supplier must remedy the issue by either repair, replacement, or if neither are possible, then a refund of the purchase price.

      8. LIABILITY
      <ol>
        <li>The Consumer Guarantees Act 1993, the Fair trading Act 1986 and any other statutes may apply warranties and conditions or impose obligations 
          upon us which cannot by law (or which can only apply to a limited extent by law) be excluded or modified. In respect of any such implied warranties, 
          conditions or terms imposed on us, our liability shall, where it is allowed, be excluded or if not able to be excluded, only apply to the lesser of the 
          minimum extent required by the relevant statute or the fees paid under invoice for the Products or Services.</li>
        <li>Except as otherwise provided in clause 8.1 in no event will we be liable (whether in contract, tort including negligence or otherwise) to you for:
          <p>(a) loss of profits or savings, loss of goodwill or opportunity, loss or corruption of data, or wasted staff time; or</p>
          <p>(b) loss, damage, cost or expense of any kind whatsoever which is indirect, consequential, or of a special nature, arising directly or 
            indirectly from any Services or Products supplied by us to you, even if we had been advised of the possibility of such loss, damage, cost or expense.</p>
        </li>
        <li>To the extent allowed by law, our total liability under any claim of any nature arising directly or indirectly from any Service or Product 
          will not exceed the Fees paid by you for that Service or Product.</li>
        <li>You indemnify us together with our officers, directors, agents, advisors and employees against any and all liability, losses, damages, costs, 
          penalties and expenses of any nature whatsoever awarded against, incurred or suffered by us, or our officers, directors, agents, advisors and employees 
          whether direct or consequential, arising out of or resulting from your breach of clause 7.7.</li>
      </ol>
    
      9. TERMINATION

          <p>(a) you are in breach of these Terms and Conditions;</p>
          <p>(b) there is any threat to the safety of any of our staff or agents;</p>
          <p>(c) there to be the presence of unlicensed or illegal software;</p>
          <p>(d) your equipment contains any pornographic, obscene, offensive or illegal content; or</p>
          <p>(e) you are insolvent, bankrupt, in liquidation, unable to pay your debts, or otherwise an unacceptable credit risk to us.</p>
        </li>
        <li>If we terminate our agreement we will cease to undertake the Services and all Fees incurred up to that time will immediately become payable.</li>
       
      </ol>
      10. GENERAL
      <ol>
        <li>We will not be liable to you for any breach or delay or failure to perform any of our obligations where such breach or delay or failure is 
          caused by anything beyond our reasonable control, including (without limitation) inability to obtain supplies, war, civil commotion, terrorism, 
          strike, lockout, other industrial act, weather phenomena or other act of God (including any failure by any of our suppliers to supply on time).</li>
