          <p>
            Computers are sophisticated, complex machines and are generally very reliable. Operating systems do alot to
            remove complexity simplifying choices down to a few options in mostly logical and intuitive ways, but 
            inevitably things can and will go wrong.
            Some errors can be as simple to fix as restarting the device. However problems can come about
            through having made a choice or sequence of choices (changes to a configuration)
            that may have helped solve one problem but have unintended consequences for something else. 
            Or it could be a permanent or intermitent hardware fault or it could be a multitude of other possibilities ...
          </p>
          <p>
            We can help to solve problems when they arise. And your help is also needed. 
          </p>
          <p>
            There's no single rule to follow in such cases but it's very helpful to know any of error messages, 
            (take a photo of the screen at the point of failures/errors), 
            and to have a clear recollection of what was being used/done at the time. Any details about what appeared on 
            screen and the sequence of events leading upto can prove also useful - each could help reduce the service costs 
            and time to resolution

            Electronic devices and components fail or get broken, We offer a limited break-fix service, typically component

            We can also recover data in a very few circumstances. Data loss for whatever reason can quickly become a highly complex task

            If your devices are superceeded by new technology, becoming surplus to requirements or are unfit for your purpose 
            some options exist.  Equipment might still serviceable or saleable. Sometimes equipment can be re-purposed 
            then gifted and used by others or put to use in less demanding functions - as always, it depends 
            on various factors.

            There are not many facilities for the disposal of electronics unfortunately. Electronics should not be thrown in 
            the household rubbish because they contain toxins, may contain batteries and they may contain valuable materials 
            in small quantities, so they need recycling and not in typical household recycling facilities.

          <p><strong>Press F1 for Help</strong> wants to help people with impartial advice, knowledge and assistance
            when purchasing or using computers, peripherals and electronics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Computers are hugely capable and sophisticated devices and using one safely and effectively in the current day
            requires a reasonably broad level of knowledge and a good deal of common sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are so many devices to choose from, and all are built, produced or optimised for different purposes
            so making informed choices in the marketplace can be daunting. No-one wants to throw money away and everyone
            wants value for money.
            In Information Technology you get what you pay for, but it may not always be the best or even a good choice
            for you
          </p>
          <p>
            When looking to make purchases, <strong>Press F1 for Help</strong> can explain the pros and cons in frank,
            impartial and plain language,
            de-mystifying complex topics, guiding you through the process of selection and purchase, eliminating confusion
            or frustration
            and putting you back in control of what’s best for you and what you want to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            And it doesn’t always end at hardware purchases and guarantees.
            There’s email, photos, data transfers, printers, inks, licenses, subscriptions, fibre or internet providers,
            phone usage, virus, scam avoidance, privacy and protection issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly, there’s more and more bad actors out there, so staying in control and safe is more and more important
            and there’s many that just want your money whether it’s good for you or not -
            <strong>Caveat Emptor</strong> has never been more relevant, or in plain language - Let the Buyer beware.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Press F1 for Help</strong> can de-mystify and reduce the complexity to simple straight forward
            ‘maxims’ and procedures.
            Advice and assistance is just a phone/video/internet call, email or in-person visit away if and when you may
            need that.

                  Most often manufacturers pre-install software on new computers and there may be a few different types
                  installed.
                  Manufacturers may have small utilities to configure the hardware and so are generally useful and should
                  never be removed.
                  These "applets" may by used to periodically update drivers specific to the hardware, be used to adjust
                  audio settings or screen parameters or update low level firmware, etc, etc.</p>
                <p>Manufacturers also often have licensing arrangements with other companies and include 3rd-party products
                  pre-installed on your new device.
                  You might have for instance a video editing suite, an antivirus product, amongst other software and of
                  course Microsoft (on Windows devices) will entice you with the Office suite of products.</p>
                <p>However some of this pre-installed software is to provide assistance, sometimes with time-limited
                  trials and subscriptions, typically designed
                  to draw the purchaser into using some paid services or to buy a license. In other words, this software
                  is optional to you and could be removed before being used
                  The potential problems here are accepting defaults, the most convenient option, because it is the
                  easiest, a few clicks away.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="content w3-half w3-padding">
                <p>Consumer electronics are designed to be convenient and easy, avoiding all the complexity that they
                  embody and automating many, many processes unknown to you.
                  This is human psychology in action. People not paying sufficient attention, not reading the T&Cs (who
                  wants to read contracts), it’s there, it’s the easiest,
                  it’s now, but there are many commercial and strategic decisions taken prior to it all arriving on your
                  table.</p>
                <p>All that convenience can come at additional costs to you. Most often it’s just your money, however if
                  it’s free to use, you often are the "product" which
                  means your data and your privacy. Electronic devices for all the benefits they provide and there are
                  many, they
                  have become central to what’s called the "surveillance economy" and that is big tech at work and
                  unfortunately some bad actors are in the mix too
                  The same is true of many web sites, they offer you something for "free", time limited use of their
                  service. with free and paid tiers that provide more
                  functionality with monthly subscriptions. It’s a lucrative business model.</p>

                <p>Less well known to many is the world of Open Source Software. This is software that anyone can download
                  and it’s totally free to use.
                  And it can be as good as or even better than the commercial equivalents albeit it’s perhaps not as
                  "slick " as the commercial ones. Your license fee or subscription pays for features you do not use.
                  Open Source is nearly always a very competent software, developed by people who are passionate about that field

                  Adobe Photoshop. GIMP, while an extremely competent software,
                  it is not as sophisticated as Photoshop but then Photoshop is and always has been, a product for
                  professionals. </p>
                <p>InkScape – A diagramming / illustration program and a competitor of Adobe
                  Illustrator, Corel Draw or Visio. Much the same can be said as for GIMP </p>
                <p>LibreOffice/OpenOffice – Are open source equivalents to Microsoft Office. Microsoft Office is a
                  sprawling suite of applications and packaged in a multitude of ways.
                  The open source options LibreOffice and OpenOffice equally have the majority of applications that are
                  bundled with MS Office and are eminently competent software </p>
                <p>Mozilla Firefox/Thunderbird – are a browser and email client that are open source equivalents to Edge &
                  Outlook (Microsoft email client). Browsers and email clients are typically
                  free to download and use, whoever makes them, but Outlook may be a paid service when bundled with
                  Office. </p>

                <p>Chrome - Google is the best search engine hands down and Google offers the Chrome browser, but in default
                  settings, Google is siphoning off
                  so much data about you and your activity, it would make your head spin. This is Big Tech, Big Data, Big Money,
                  targeted advertising, 'profiling' and the 'surveillance economy'.
                  Some people are OK with that, some are blissfully ignorant of those facts, others not so keen. </p>
                <p>Problems that plague commercial software like bugs and security vulnerabilities are generally
                  lesser in open source software for a couple of reasons.
                  Primarily bad actors tend to target the major products in the marketplace. Secondly, with open source
                  software many people can read the program source code for the product - many eyes identify and eliminate
                  most of the problems and automated software can scan for the typical vulnerabilities found in software. 
                  However, for commercial software, the code base is closed source,
                  a proprietary secret, so fewer eyes get to see and work on it. Security scanning and safe coding practices
                  may be laxer or even absent.</p>
                <p>The key take aways of this message are: open source software is free to use, for every commercial product, 
                  there is nearly always an Open Source alternative and finally commercial software 
                  does not necessarily mean better or safer software but it is guaranteed to cost you more to use.
                 </p>
                <p>But the real bonus with Open Source Software is you can terminate many of those subscriptions and
                  licenses and buy a few more lattes or whatever floats your marshmellow.</p>

              <!-- <p class="w3-opacity subtitle"></p> -->
              <div class="content w3-half w3-padding">
                <p>One of the recent technical game changers was the advent of Lithium Ion (li-ion) batteries and a few
                  closely related variants.
                  It made batteries smaller and hold more power. Correspondingly, technology became smaller and more
                  portable. Now almost everything has a battery in it.</p>
                <p>As with everything, for all the upsides this brings, there are some downsides.</p>
                <p>A characteristic of this battery chemistry, is that they "lose memory", meaning that after repeated
                  charge/discharge cycles (typical usage patterns)
                  they can no longer charge back up to the original 100% and the total percentage charge degrades over
                  time.
                  Two options exist for older batteries that do not have much "autonomy" (can’t hold a decent charge),
                  either replace the battery or replace the entire product.
                  Often it’s the product because of the economics of replacements and/or technical obsolescence.
                  Therefore, it’s better to take care of batteries when new, to make them last longer. </p>
                <p>It’s easier to say than to do but the good battery care guide would say: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Discharge completely the battery before putting the device on charge again</li>
                  <li>Once fully or near fully charged, disconnect the charger / take it off charging.</li>
                  <li>Switch device off if it’s not to be used and unplug</li>
                  <li>If a device is to be left unused for an extended period, remove the battery (if possible), store in
                    a neutral, dry area</li>
                </ul>

              </div>
              <div class="content w3-half w3-padding">
                <p>These are the basic rules. There are also some don’t ever dos and some be awares</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Do not dispose of the battery in the household rubbish – they’re a potential fire hazard and toxic
                    in the environment.</li>
                  <li>Some electronics equipment have built in power management and stop the battery from being
                    over-charged but that depends
                    entirely on the quality/cost of the product but you shouldn’t rely on that.</li>
                  <li>Like everything manufactured, a very large percentage of the products meet all the required safety
                    standards and pass manufacturing line tests
                    however there will always be a percentage, however small that fail and with Li-ion batteries, when
                    they fail, it can be very dangerous.
                    Heat is often a precursor to failure, when a device is left on charge longer than necessary or left in
                    the sun, the battery can swell up in size
                    and pop open or worse ignite in a run-away ignition</li>
                  <li>If the battery suffers physical damage/deformation then it should be replaced. Do not use the
                    battery</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The problem with probabilities is that the probability will eventually happen. A probability of one in a
                  million will
                  happen on average once in a million times. You just do want to be the one involved when that small
                  probability happens.</p>

              <div class="content w3-half w3-padding">
                <p>The Wonderful World Wide Web is truly a huge treasure trove, full of delight. It’s the largest library
                  and art gallery on the planet,
                  with entertainments everywhere. It’s the biggest department store and supermarket, the biggest storage
                  locker there is, ever. You can even
                  find out what’s happening in real time, connect and socialise, collaborate and work there, not to
                  mention it is the progenitor of the latest and greatest technologies.</p>
                <p>But as with everything, while it hosts many absolutely brilliant, beautiful, wonderful and practical
                  things (upsides), it also has some real bummers (downsides).
                  Queue in please viruses, trojans, worms, scams, identity and financial theft, hackers, bigotry,
                  disinformation, keyboard-warriors, anti-social behaviour, crime and some
                  truly dark corners of total depravity and the worst of human kind.</p>
                <p>This is not an exhaustive or even a very long list of potential dangers and nasties out there in the
                  world wide web. Within each group of threats, there’s a multitude
                  of techniques and levels of danger. The Internet can be a dangerous place for the unsuspecting and
                  unwary. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="content w3-half w3-padding">
                <p>When you meet someone face to face in society, typically it’s in a trusting manner, society would not
                  work very well if this were not the case.
                  However on-line (the Internet) the dynamic has changed completely to the opposite. What outwardly and
                  superficially looks decent, innocent and honest
                  could actually be quite or even very deceptive.</p>
                <p> Humans are not fast enough and cannot see what happens underneath the slick surface presentation (not
                  without the right tools anyway) – as always it depends – who, what, where, when.
                  Operating on the Internet and staying away from trouble is not that difficult but it requires vigilance,
                  attention, a bit of discipline and a bit of scepticism (unfortunately). </p>
                <p>It would be easy to rabbit on at length about these things (because they are particularly annoying
                  things) but <a href="https://netsafe.org.nz/">NetSafe NZ</a> has better material to watch and read to learn about
                  these things and is not as opinionated</p>

              – match a description, sample or model shown to you
              – have good legal title, e.g. be able to be sold and not have any security interests registered against them
              – be a reasonable price if no price is set
              – arrive on time (within a reasonable time if not agreed) and in good condition
              – have spare parts and repair facilities available (manufacturer is responsible). This does not apply if you
              are told about limited availability before you buy.

              If these guarantees are not met, the supplier must remedy the issue by either repair, replacement, or if
              neither are possible, then a refund of the purchase price.

          </ol>

          8. LIABILITY
          <ol>
            <li>
              The Consumer Guarantees Act 1993, the Fair trading Act 1986 and any other statutes may apply warranties
              and conditions or impose obligations upon us which cannot by law (or which can only apply to a limited 
              extent by law) be excluded or modified. In respect of any such implied warranties, conditions or terms 
              imposed on us, our liability shall, where it is allowed, be excluded or if not able to be excluded, 
              only apply to the lesser of the minimum extent required by the relevant statute or the fees paid under 
              invoice for the Products or Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Except as otherwise provided in clause 8.1 in no event will we be liable (whether in contract, tort
              including negligence or otherwise) to you for:
              <p>
                (a) loss of profits or savings, loss of goodwill or opportunity, loss or corruption of data, or wasted
                staff time; or
              </p>
              <p>
                (b) loss, damage, cost or expense of any kind whatsoever which is indirect, consequential, or of a
                special nature, arising directly or indirectly from any Services or Products supplied by us to you, 
                even if we had been advised of the possibility of such loss, damage, cost or expense.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              To the extent allowed by law, our total liability under any claim of any nature arising directly or
              indirectly from any Service or Product will not exceed the Fees paid by you for that Service or Product.
            </li>
            <li>
              You indemnify us together with our officers, directors, agents, advisors and employees against any and all
              liability, losses, damages, costs, penalties and expenses of any nature whatsoever awarded against, 
              incurred or suffered by us, or our officers, directors, agents, advisors and employees whether direct 
              or consequential, arising out of or resulting from your breach of clause 7.7.
            </li>
          </ol>

          9. TERMINATION
          <ol>
            <li>We may immediately terminate the agreement between us if we consider:
              <p>
                (a) you are in breach of these Terms and Conditions;
              </p>
              <p>
                (b) there is any threat to the safety of any of our staff or agents;
              </p>
              <p>
                (c) there to be the presence of unlicensed or illegal software;
              </p>
              <p>
                (d) your equipment contains any pornographic, obscene, offensive or illegal content; or
              </p>
              <p>
                (e) you are insolvent, bankrupt, in liquidation, unable to pay your debts, or otherwise an unacceptable
                credit risk to us.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              If we terminate our agreement we will cease to undertake the Services and all Fees incurred up to that
              time will immediately become payable.
            </li>

          </ol>
          10. GENERAL
          <ol>
            <li>
              We will not be liable to you for any breach or delay or failure to perform any of our obligations where
              such breach or delay or failure is caused by anything beyond our reasonable control, including (without 
              limitation) inability to obtain supplies, war, civil commotion, terrorism, strike, lockout, other 
              industrial act, weather phenomena or other act of God (including any failure by any of our suppliers 
              to supply on time).
            </li>
            <li>
              The current Terms and Conditions at any time are available on this website: 
            </li>
            <li>
              New Zealand law governs the formation, validity, construction and performance of these Terms and
              Conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              These Terms and Conditions shall be binding on your legal representation, assignees and successors.
            </li>
            <li>
              If any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be invalid, void, illegal or unenforceable, the
              validity, existence, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected, 
              prejudiced or impaired.
            </li>
            <li>
              No failure or delay on our part in exercising any power or right under these Terms and Conditions will
              operate as a waiver.
            </li>
